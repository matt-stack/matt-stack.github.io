Hello! I am currently a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Delaware and I am working in the Computational Research and Programming Lab! I am student to all things computer science, but I have found an affinity for High Performance Computing. I strive to one day be able to work with High Performance Computing in the field of animation and rendering! For more info about UDel's CRPL https://crpl.cis.udel.edu/
