Hello! I am currently a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Delaware and I am working in the [Computational Research and Programming Lab (CRPL)](https://crpl.cis.udel.edu/)! I am student to all things computer science, but I have found an affinity for High Performance Computing and Parallel Computing. I strive to one day be able to work with high performance computing in the field of animation and rendering!

Projects
======
* **PhysiCell_GPU- Undergraduate Research**
  
  (Winter 2019 - present)
  
  Acclerating PhysiCell on GPU
  
  Dr. Sunita Chandrasekaran, Dr Paul Macklin
  
  [BioFVM is a tool from Dr Paul Macklin](http://mathcancer.org/) for scientists to model cellular environments and how they react to single or multiple substrates. Currently BioFVM is parallelized by OpenMP for CPU. My projects goal is to take the code to the GPU with OpenACC to unlock new expansive possiblities for Dr Macklin's mathematical models. I started this project in May of 2018 as a UDel Summer Scholar (research internship position at the university), and am continuing as an Independent Study under the advisement of Dr. Chandrasekaran. I have taken a Parallel Computing class and loved the work I did there, but this is my first real world project! The [Blog](posts/2012/08/blog-post-1/) page explores the development of the acceleration project from the start of the process to now!

  * **ACC-BioFVM- Undergraduate Research**
  
  (Summer 2019 - Winter 2019)
  
  Acclerating an open source Fintie Volume Method for Biological Problems on GPUs
  
  Dr. Sunita Chandrasekaran, Dr Paul Macklin

  * **VIP-HPC**
  
(very secret, check back later for information when it I can say more!)
    
  * **Classification Tree Educational Tool- UDel CISC Study Abroad**
  
  (New Zealand, Winter 2019)
  
  The Classification Tree Educational Tool was developed by my education game development group during my study abroad in Christchurch New Zealand. We were tasked by New Zealand's own computer science education genius Dr Tim Bell to create a simple game to convey a complex computer science concept for a grade school level. My group created a game to explain the general idea of a decision tree and incorporated easy to follow instructions and visuals. We learned how to develop in Unity and created this game in less than one month. Check out the GitHub [here](https://github.com/matt-stack/ClassificationTree)!

  * **EsturaryVille- Software Engineering Semester Project**
  
  EsturaryVille is a java game created by my software engineering group for our client the Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve (DNERR). The goal was to create a friendly game that could be deployed at the vistor center on tablets for grade school kids that would draw their attention and sneakily teach them about the importance of esturaries! We developed 3 esturary-based minigames and an overworld to navigate to the games. Along with the research minigame, I created all the elements for every game from scratch. A few of these animated elements can be seen below. I love animation but have never worked in 2d sprites, let alone animating sprite sheets. Thankfully the internet is a wonderful place for induldging technical passions and learning from scratch. Check out the GitHub for the game [here](https://github.com/JTurk14/Estuaryville)!

Personal Project
======
  I am very interested in realistic rendering, especially roomscapes. I spent a summer while I was lifeguarding learning to render with Blender and even built a pc with the purpose of faster gpu rendering. These shots are from a project to model my old dorm room. I am fascinated by the computer science + math behind animation and rendering.

Fun Facts
======
  I am a founding member of Competative Rock Climbing Team at UDel and love to compete! I also always look forward to when I can transfer training on indoor walls and hangboards to outside bouldering (and on occasion sport climbing).

  I am an experienced backpacker and longtime member of Udel's Outing Club. I love planning trips and exploring the natural world in such a initmate way!

  Favorite Books I would recommend to anyone
  
  * Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, Susan Cain
  
  The lessons in this book had a massive impact on my life I wish I had read it earlier. As an introvert, very few people will tell you it is okay to be quiet. My favorite quote from this book is "Sometimes introverted kids are made to feel freaky for the force of these passions, when in fact studies show that this is the sort of intensity is a prerequisite to talent development", as I have definetly had people question the ablitly to focus on one task for hours. Rowing, climbing, backpacking, and swimming are a few of my favorite hobbies, and they all are defined by silence in a way I am drawn to. It lets me be me.

  * The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History, Elizabeth Kolbert
  
  I read this book during my study abroad in New Zealand and it was absolutely fascinating to see some of the elements from the book in person. I went to a Moa sancurary where I looked out at one of the few remain kiwi left in our world and saw the bones of giant Moa driven to extiniction by human hands. When I saw this and learned more about the history of the southern island, the lessons and warning in The Sixth Extinction were vibrantly clear.

  * Becoming, Michelle Obama
  
  This book opened my eyes to another life entirely different from my own. My all time favorite quote from this book is "I had nothing or I had everything. It depends in which way you want to tell it." Its such a powerful statement that perfectly encapsulates the book.
