There and Back Again: Trends in my Daily Notes from my First Scientific Computing Project (GPU)
======
Matt Stack

Glad you made it! Starting a new project is never easy, especially when the information you need begins becoming scarce and hidden in the technical manual pages. We can't rely on Google in scientific computing, and getting a handle on that handicap is tough. I started my first GPU acceleration project in the summer and these are the trends from the daily notes I took. You can use them to optimize your project workflow and habits for navigating roadblocks.

**Now, Where to Start**
My current project is to accelerate a cellular modeling codebase called BioFVM. I am not a biologist in any sense of the word. Sitting down in that first meeting and reading the papers supporting the algorithms driving the code was downright confusing. Where do you start? Knowing the answer to this question could have saved me many hours. These tips are what I will certainly use to tackle my next project:
Set expectations low at first
No one can hope to match the intellect of a brilliant domain professor overnight; take it slow and steady.
Map the unknown (domain science) to the known (your polished computer science skills)
Disclaimer: This only works well when the original domain code is well written (thankfully BioFVM was extremely well written and is open source so anyone can take a peek).
Start small 
Identifying a minimal project you can produce in a realistic timeline; This can help you identify how to frame the workflow for the coming months.

**When the Error Trail Ends**
The toughest part of maintaining flow in a project occurs when you lose the ability to track the errors back to a particular source. For me this error was “Error 700: Illegal Address in Kernel Execution,” which simply is the GPU saying “good try”. GPU programming with directives is tricky enough, but when the errors aren’t descriptive, morale can quickly take a nosedive. The trends from my own project point to:
Fall back to what you know
This can be tough and may feel like admitting temporary defeat, but think of it as simply a new viewpoint of the problem.
Shape the problems
Problems can be hard to pinpoint, especially in massive projects, so make a standalone testbench with the minimal amount of code to simulate the flow of the real project.
Keep a list of places you've been
I let myself get caught in a circle of reading the same manuals over and over trying to find something new, avoid this by jotting down notes whether each manual was helpful or not.

**Conclusion: There and Back Again**
I found a calming comfort looking back at the trends of my daily notes. There were times when progress seemed hopeless and times when I couldn’t type fast enough to keep up with new ideas. Nothing can prepare you better than giving it a try, but hopefully these tips can make the initial submersion easier. 

Just remember, what you see is not all there is!
